            <p></b>peacock</b>, any of three species of resplendent birds of the pheasant family, Phasianidae (order
                Galliformes).
                Strictly, the male is a peacock, and the female is a peahen; both are peafowl. The two most-recognizable
                species
                of peafowl are the blue, or Indian, peacock (Pavo cristatus), of India and Sri Lanka, and the green, or
                Javanese, peacock (P. muticus), found from Myanmar (Burma) to Java. The Congo peacock (Afropavo
                congensis),
                which inhabits the forested interior of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, was discovered in 1936
                after a
                search that began in 1913 with the finding of a single feather.</p>

            <h1>Natural History</h1>
            <p>In blue and green peacocks, the male has a 90–130-cm (35–50-inch) body and 150-cm (60-inch) train of tail
                feathers that are coloured a brilliant metallic green. This train is mainly formed of the bird’s upper
                tail
                coverts, which are enormously elongated. Each feather is tipped with an iridescent eyespot that is
                ringed
                with
                blue and bronze. In courtship displays, the cock elevates his tail, which lies under the train, thus
                elevating
                the train and bringing it forward. At the climax of this display, the tail feathers are vibrated, giving
                the
                feathers of the train a shimmering appearance and making a rustling sound.</p>

            <h1>Peacock</h1>
            <p>Male peacocks have long colorful feathers. Most of the time the feathers trail behind them. When the
                birds
                want
                to attract attention, the feathers are raised to form an impressive display. Using either your mouse or

            <img src="../image/peacoc.PNG" alt="pic">
            <p>The blue peacock’s body feathers are mostly metallic blue-green. The green peacock, with a train much
                like
                that
                of the blue, has green and bronze body feathers. Hens of both species are green and brown and are almost
                as
                big
                as the male but lack the train and the head ornament. In the wild, both species live in open lowland
                forests,
                flocking by day and roosting high in trees at night. During the breeding season, the male forms a harem
                of
                two
                to five hens, each of which lays four to eight whitish eggs in a depression in the ground. The eggs are
                incubated by the peahen until they hatch some 28 days later. The chicks have all of their feathers when
                they
                emerge from their eggs and are capable of flight roughly one week after hatching. Most blue and green
                peafowl
                become sexually mature at age three. However, some male blue peafowl have been known to breed as early
                as
                age
                two.</p>

            <p>As an ornamental bird, the peacock is a staple resident of many of the world’s zoos and has long been
                famous
                throughout the Old World. Green peacocks in captivity must be kept apart from other fowl, though,
                because of
                their aggressive disposition. Blue peacocks, though native to warm humid climates, can survive northern
                winters.
                Green peacocks, however, cannot tolerate much cold.</p>
            <p>The Congo peacock is the only large phasianid in Africa. The cock is mainly blue and green with a short
                rounded
                tail. The hen is reddish and green with a brown topknot. The species is smaller than those in genus
                Pavo,
                growing to roughly between 64 and 70 cm (25 to 28 inches) in length by adulthood.</p>
